# Fight-for-the-Future

This is a fighting game made in a team of 3 during the first semester of 2021 for the final project of Game Engine II, at LaSalle College, Montr√©al.
The course consisted in learning and implementing more complex features in Unity, such as multiplayer. In addition, it was used Agile and Scrum methodologies to better understand these concepts.
This game has 3 distinct playmodes (tutorial, training and PvP), character selection (3 characters; each of them has different gameplay) and stage selection (3 arenas). 
Call your friend and give it a try!
